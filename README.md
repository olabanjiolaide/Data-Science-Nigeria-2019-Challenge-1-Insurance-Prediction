The incidence of building collapses in Lagos and other major Nigerian cities has recently increased. Olusola Insurance Company provides a building insurance coverage that covers structures from damage caused by fire, vandalism, flooding, or storms.  You've been hired as the Lead Data Analyst to develop a predictive model that will forecast whether or not a building will have an insurance claim within a given time period. You'll have to forecast the likelihood of at least one claim throughout the building's insured period.The model will be based on the features of the building. Claim is the target variable.  1 if the structure has had at least one claim during the covered period. If there hasn't been a claim on the structure throughout the covered period, the value is 0.
